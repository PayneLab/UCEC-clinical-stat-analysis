This folder contains notebooks examining the mutation of several genes and the effect on its corresponding protein. Particularly, the effect of truncation mutation on proteomic abundance and phosphorylation levels in the MSI subtype is illustrated. ARID1A, RBM27, INPPL1, JAK1, CTNNB1, TP53, CCND1, AHNAK, KMT2D, FLNA, ADD3, and CTNNB1 are examined.
