This folder contains notebooks examining the mutation of several genes and the effect on its corresponding protein. Particularly, the effect of truncation mutation on proteomic abundance and phosphorylation levels in the MSI subtype is illustrated. ARID1A, RBM27, INPPL1, JAK1, CTNNB1, TP53, CCND1, AHNAK, KMT2D, FLNA, ADD3, and CTNNB1 are examined.

This notebook examines the effect of gene mutation on proteomic abundance in ARID1A, RBM27, INPPL1, JAK1, CTNNB1, TP53, and CCND1. Particularly, it illustrates the effect of truncation mutation, as compared to other mutation and wildtype. These differences are compared in MSI and MSS subtypes.
