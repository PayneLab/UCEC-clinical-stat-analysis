This folder contains notebooks examining the mutation of several genes and the effect on its corresponding protein. Particularly, the effect of truncation mutation on proteomic abundance and phosphorylation levels in the MSI subtype is illustrated. ARID1A, RBM27, INPPL1, JAK1, CTNNB1, TP53, CCND1, AHNAK, KMT2D, FLNA, ADD3, and CTNNB1 are examined.

MSI_Protein_Plots: This notebook examines the effect of gene mutation on proteomic abundance in ARID1A, RBM27, INPPL1, JAK1, CTNNB1, TP53, and CCND1. Particularly, it illustrates the effect of truncation mutation, as compared to other mutation and wildtype. These differences are compared in MSI and MSS subtypes.

MSI_Phos_Plots: This notebook looks at the effect of gene mutation on phosphorylation levels in ARID1A, AHNAK, KMT2D, FLNA, ADD3, and CTNNB1. We examine the difference in phosphorylation levels for 5 phosphorylation sites in each protein, when the coding gene is mutated as compared to when it is not. These 5 sites are determined by a t-test comparing the mutated and wildtype groups.

MSI_Phos_MSI_Vs_MSS: In this notebook we look at the effect of gene mutation on phosphorylation levels in ARID1A, AHNAK, KMT2D, FLNA, ADD3, and CTNNB1, and how this varies by MSI subtype. MSI wildtype and mutated groups are compared with MSS wildtype and mutated groups.

MSI_Phos_Truncation: This notebook looks at the same proteins outlined above (ARID1A, AHNAK, KMT2D, FLNA, ADD3, and CTNNB1), and examines the effect of truncation mutation in the coding gene on phosphorylation levels. This difference is looked at in the MSI and MSS subtypes, comparing truncation, other mutations, and wildtype in both groups.

MSI_Protein_and_Phos_Images: This notebook has all all the images (plots) from each of the other notebooks in this directory, put together in one place and sorted by notebook.
